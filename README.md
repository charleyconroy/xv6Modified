# xv6Modified
Final Project for Operating Systems class
This is a version of xv6 that has been modified to allow users to adjust the order that programs execute in, first by changing the round robin scheduler to a priority based scheduler. I then implemented a user function called nice() that while working similarly to the C function it's based off of, instead increases the priority of a given process.
Report.pdf is the report I turned into my class and goes very in depth about the exact changes I made to xv6.
